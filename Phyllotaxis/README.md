# Phyllotaxis

In botany, phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy is the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem.

## key concepts

### main formula

$\phi = n * 137.5 \degree,$ $r = c \sqrt n$

- $n$ is the ordering number of a floret, counting outward from the center. This is the reverse of floret age in a real plant.
- $\phi$ is the angle between a reference direction and the position vector of the nth floret in a polar coordinate system originating at the center of the capitulum. It follows that the divergence angle between the position vectors of any two successive florets is constant, $a = 137.5\degree$.
- $r$ is the distance between the center of the capitulum and the center of the nth floret, given a constant scaling parameter $c$

### other stuff

- `sin()` and `cos()` for floret rotation
